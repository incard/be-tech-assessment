# incard tech assessment


Create a service that will handle multi user management. 

- Users should be assigned a role during creation. Possible roles `owner, admin, employee`.
- Each role will have certain restrictions while calling apis e.g.
  - `owner` can edit/create/delete/read
  - `admin` can edit/create/read
  - `employee` can read only
- Add endpoints to perform the above actions. 



You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).
